    "### Objective\n",
    "To write Python code to accomplish the creation of π by creating a new estimate using [Monte Carlo simulation](https://www.ibm.com/topics/monte-carlo-simulation). \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique relies on simulation and random numbers to estimate the value of π essentially by throwing darts at a board inscribed with a circle and counting how many darts land inside the circle and how many land outside the circle. I will stick to a computer-based simulation. To simplify, I will use the first quadrant unit square as suggested in the article."

    "### Methodology\n",
    "1. For each dart thrown, I generated its coordinates, _x_ and _y_, using a random uniform distribution from 0 - 1. The NumPy `uniform` method was used to generate these random coordinates with `seed=12345`.. \n",
    "2. If the dart is inside the quarter-circle, I counted it. A dart is inside the quarter-circle if its distance from the origin (0, 0) is <= 1. \n",
    "3. I calculated the square root of the sum of squares to get the distance.\n",
    "4. After all the darts have been thrown and counted, Pi was estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "I used the NumPy library which makes it relatively easy to implement vectorized solutions of Monte Carlo simulations such as this. \n",
    "I then used matplotlib to create and display a plot showing each of the coordinates generated as a dot in the unit square using different colors for the points within the unit circle and the points outside the unit circle.\n"
